## Strategies

- Equal Weight : Distributes funds equally across all stocks. Simple and consistent.

- Mean Variance Optimization : Selects the most stable stock combination based on historical data. Safe but tends to be conservative.

- Deep Learning Model : Uses AI to predict stock movements and dynamically adjust allocations. Aggressive, can yield large profits but is volatile.
