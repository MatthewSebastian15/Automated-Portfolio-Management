# Automated Portfolio Management: Deep Learning vs. Traditional Strategies

# Strategies

- **Equal Weight :** This strategy assigns exactly the same weight to each stock in the portfolio, for example, 10 stocks of 10 percent each, with a flat weighting of 1/N, regardless of volatility or historical performance. The approach is very simple and objective, and it effectively reduces risk when a single stock falls due to the evenly distributed diversification.

- **Mean Variance Optimization :** This strategy uses Markowitz's modern portfolio theory to construct an Efficient Frontier by calculating expected returns and covariance to minimize risk at a given return level. This disciplined and cautious approach is suitable for investors who prioritize capital stability and want to avoid extreme fluctuations in the Indonesian stock market.

- **Deep Learning Model :** This strategy uses an LSTM neural network to learn historical stock price time-series patterns and predict future price movements. Its approach is aggressive and alpha-oriented, capable of quickly capturing market momentum, but carries higher prediction risk than classical statistical methods.
